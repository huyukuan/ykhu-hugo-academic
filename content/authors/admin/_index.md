I am a Ph.D. candidate of [Optimization Group](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~optim/) at Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), under the supervision of [Professor Xin Liu](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~liuxin/). I received the Bachelor degree (2019) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Tongji University. My research interests focus on developing numerical optimization methods for scientific and engineering applications. Recently, I have been working on the topics in computational materials science.
